Vs Cleerly\n- Echocardiogram: KIV if no full body MRI Detailed heart imaging.\n- Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT) Scan: Assess carotid artery health.\n\n4. Overall health and fitness:\n- VO2 Max Testing: Provides insights into aerobic capacity and endurance [adjusted to conditioning level]/prior PARQ assessment]\n- Grip strength assessment: Well correlated with longevity and overall health\n- Functional Movement Screening (FMS): Assesses movement patterns, balance, and stability\n- Indirect Calorimetry/DLW\n- Spirometry\n\n5. Genetic Testing:\n- Hereditary Risk Assessment: Based on family history.\n- Pharmacogenomics: Personalised drug response prediction.\n\n6. Body Composition Analysis:\n- DEXA Scan: Measures bone density, fat, and muscle mass.\n\n7. Hormone Profiling:\n- Thyroid Function Tests: TSH, T3, T4 levels.\n- Sex Hormone Levels: Estradiol, testosterone, progesterone.\n\n8. Nutritional Assessment:\n- Micronutrient Levels: Vitamins, minerals, antioxidants.\n- Food Allergy Testing: Identify sensitivities.\n- Gut microbiome\n\n9. Brain Health Assessment:\n- Cognitive Function Tests: Memory, attention, executive function.\n- Mental health review: Assess mood, stress\n- Brain MRI: MRI stroke screen Detects early signs of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n10. Skin Analysis\n- VISIA\n\n11.
